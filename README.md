# dark-light-mode-toggle-button

## Introduction 

An animated toggle button which features a scenic display in light and dark mode. This includes a linear gradient button inspired by sunrise and sunset colours. Simply click the toggle button to switch between light and dark modes. The website's body (background) will change to match the selected modes. Enjoy!

## Built With :hammer:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

## What I Learnt :books:

After creating the light, dark mode feature using BootstrapCDN learnt from my web development course with <a href="https://codefirstgirls.com/">Code First Girls.</a>  I decided to create a simple toggle button in light and dark mode in order to develop my JavaScript skills aswell as continuing to develop my understanding of transition speeds. <a href="https://osaze-ai.github.io/cfgproject/about.html">BootstrapCDN Web Preview.</a>


## Code I Am Proud Of :smiley:

I developed my understanding of transition styling using css code and learnt how to transform the toggle button to fit into the checkbox. I will continue to build upon this skill to create more dynamic transitions and improve user experience.
